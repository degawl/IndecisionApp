# IndecisionApp

A starter React web-app I made while taking a course on web development with React.

## Installation

```sh
git clone git@github.com:degawl/indecisionapp.git
cd indecisionapp
npm install
npm start
```

## Usage

- Visualize a list of options you've decided on.
- Have the app decide what option to pursue with a popup.
